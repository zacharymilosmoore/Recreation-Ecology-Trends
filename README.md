Examining the correlation between visitation to National Parks and Google Trends search interest.
 
During COVID-19, it has been postulated that people have been using outdoor ('natural') spaces more. There is the possibility that increased human traffic in these outdoor spaces could have wildlife implications from a recreation ecology perspective. However, human visitation to most outdoor spaces is not actively monitored, and thus it is impossible to gauge how human traffic may have changed, let alone how it may be impacting the ecology of the area.

I hypothesized that internet search interest for certain terms as detailed in Google Trends data may be a viable proxy for visitation rates. I obtained visitation data to national parks and historic sites in Canada between 2015 and 2021 to test whether Google Trends data served as a reasonable predictor of human traffic. 

The project is still ongoing, but preliminary results support that when visitation is sufficiently high, Google Trends data serves as moderate predictor of visitation rates. This warrants further exploration into the potential usage of this free online data for conservation purposes.
